# Rubiks-Cube-Solver

 1. Modelled a virtual Rubik’s Cube (3x3) in both 3D and 2D representations using standard data structures in C++
 
 2. Achieved a solving time of 3 seconds for a Rubik’s Cube jumbled 8 times using algorithms like BFS, DFS, and IDFFS

 3. Implemented Korf’s IDA* Algorithm, achieving a solving time of under 10 seconds for a Rubik’s Cube jumbled 13 times
